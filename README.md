# rki
Convert RKI data on covid-19 from json to csv.

## Requirements
- To process json i use `jq` - the swiss army knife for json.
  Install it via its [github homepage](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) or using a package manager like `brew`
- I used the gnu version of `date` here to deal. You can install it using homebrew with `brew install gdate`.
