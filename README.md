# rki
Convert RKI data on covid-19 from json to csv.

## Requirements
- To process json we require `jq` - the swiss army knife for json.
  Install it via its [github homepage](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) or using a package manager like `brew`
- For OS X the gnu version of `date` i used - For ubuntu or raspbian simply remove the `g` in `gdate`.
  You can install the gnu version using homebrew with `brew install gdate`. I was too lazy to change the date converter.
